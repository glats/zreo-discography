# Zreo discography robot downloader

A long time ago I was listening to a lot of video game music (called VGM) and I found a wonderful band doing symphonic cover called Zelda Reorchestrated. But then I lost sight of them.  
Now when I wanted to listen to them I realized that they stopped making records. The good thing is that they are still downloadable and in ogg.  
Unfortunately the page has all the downloads separated and you would have to go one by one.
With this I decided to practice my skills in golang and I did a scrapper and concurrent download and this was the result.  
At the end I wished two things: to listen again to the music I like so much and to keep on practicing my skills in golang.

Thanks for reading!
